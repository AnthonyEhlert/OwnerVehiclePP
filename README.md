# OwnerVehiclePP

This project is a web based project designed to have owner and vehicle objects that can be stored in a MySQL database.

The concept is that an owner can have many vehicles, but a vehicle can only have one owner.

The JSP files and servlets allow new owners and vehicles to be added to the database, edited, and deleted from the database.

There is also a FileConverter class included to convert Java LocalDate to SQL Date.
